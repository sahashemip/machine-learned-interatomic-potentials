## qNEP for CrSBr
Chromium sulfide bromide (CrSBr) is a layered direct bandgap semiconductor that can be exfoliated down to a two-dimensional (2D) magnet.
It consists of van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic monolayers that are coupled antiferromagnetically, to the adjacent layers, along the stacking direction.

This developed potential can be used for studying defects in monolayer to fewlayer and bulk CrSBr.
