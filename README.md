This repository offers a step-by-step workflow for developing **machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)** for materials modeling. You’ll find examples, scripts, and recommended practices for data preparation, training, benchmarking, and using the resulting potentials in atomistic simulations—designed to be transferable across multiple projects (bulk, surfaces, interfaces, and defects).
